<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of mplush5 is to put functions that read the Mplus h5 file into
a R package.

The functions were written by Thuy Nguyen of Muthen & Muthen and are
available at <https://www.statmodel.com/mplus-R/H5Results.zip>.

## Installation

You can install the development version of mplush5 from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dougtommet/mplush5")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(mplush5)
## basic example code
# h5_path <- path_to_h5_file
# mplus.view.results(h5_path)
# mplus.print.model.results(h5_path)
```
